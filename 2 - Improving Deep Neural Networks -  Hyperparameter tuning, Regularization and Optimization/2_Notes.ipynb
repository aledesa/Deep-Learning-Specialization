So the dev set just needs to be big enough for you to evaluate, say, two different algorithm choices or ten different algorithm choices and quickly decide which one is doing better. For example, if you have a million examples, if you need just 10,000 for your dev and 10,000 for your test, your ratio will be 1% of 1 million so you'll have 98% train, 1% dev, 1% test."
